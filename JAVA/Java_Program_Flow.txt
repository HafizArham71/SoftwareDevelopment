When a Java program starts, the JVM first loads the class that contains main(). While loading this class, the JVM executes all static fields and static blocks in the exact order they appear in the file. After the class is fully initialized, the JVM begins running the main() method.

Inside main(), when the JVM encounters new B(), it prepares to create an object of class B. Before it can do that, the JVM checks whether class B has already been loaded. If not, the JVM loads its parent class first. During the parent class’s loading phase, all static fields and static blocks of the parent run exactly once. After the parent has finished loading, the JVM loads class B and executes its static fields and static blocks.

Once both classes are loaded, the actual object-creation process begins. The statement new B() calls the constructor of B. If the constructor does not explicitly start with super(...), the JVM automatically inserts a call to the parent constructor.

Whenever a constructor runs, the JVM ensures that all parent classes are fully initialized. Because the parent is already loaded, the super() call runs the parent constructor. During this step, the JVM initializes all instance fields of the parent and executes any parent instance blocks before running the parent constructor body. After the parent constructor completes, the JVM initializes the instance fields of the child, runs the child’s instance blocks, and finally executes the child’s constructor body.
